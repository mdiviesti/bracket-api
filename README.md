# bracket-api

### Description
MongoDB, Express, NodeJS API to manage tournament brackets for sports teams. 

This project is set up as an API to handle tournament play for sports and other tournaments. While its routes suggest 
team sports it is easily adaptable to table game and other tournaments.


### collaboration
I wouldn't mind having someone who wants to work in NodeJS giving me a hand with this. As I said, it's mostly a 
"teaching myself" project which will result in something useful. I don't mind at all if folks want to join in.
